A simple repository for my GitHub training session

Hello, Everyone,

I've been asked by several people to put together a brief training session on how to use GitHub.  We use GitHub at Microsoft to manage many different opensource projects. For the purposes of this training we will focus on how we can use GitHub to work with our Docs team to comment on, request changes and open a pull request to documentation stored on GitHub.
